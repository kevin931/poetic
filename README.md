## About

The Poetry Predictor is a Python desktop application based on Natural Language Processing and deep learning models to predict how poetic sentences are. Trained on 18th- and 19th-century works, the model predicts how likely the given input is poetry.

This initiative is originally part of the Robert Mayer Undergraduate Research Fellowship but now an independent, continuing project.

#### Why should you care?

- Are you ever in awe that a random phrase seems so **sexily poetic**?
- Do you ever wonder whether your love letter is up to the standards of famous poets or are compliments you get merely compliments?
- Can you imagine a software that helps define poetry in the digital age?

Look no further. You have found the poetry predictor.

**Have fun!!**

## Installation
#### The Recommended Way:
1. **Manual installation** of python and Anaconda required for **all platforms** at this time.
2. For detailed installation steps of Anaconda, please refer to [this guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
3. Clone the GitHub repo (for Windows users without Git installed, downloading the repository using [this link](https://github.com/kevin931/PoetryPredictor/archive/master.zip) is okay, too!):
```shell
git clone https://github.com/kevin931/PoetryPredictor.git
```
4. Virtual environment activation:
```shell
cd DIRECTORY_PATH_OF_PROGRAM
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
5. To verify the program has installed correctly, run
```shell
cd DIRECTORY_PATH_OF_PROGRAM
conda activate PoetryPredictor
python Launch.py
```

#### The Other ~~Not So Easy~~ Way:
* Use of virtual environment is still highly encouraged!
* The program will run with the following packages:
  * python 3.7.7
  * numpy 1.18.1
  * tensorflow 2.1.0
  * gensim 3.8.0
* Support for other versions not guaranteed.

## Run the Program
If everything installs successfully, run the following commands for every subsequent launch:
```shell
cd DIRECTORY_PATH_OF_PROGRAM
conda activate PoetryPredictor
python Launch.py
```

## Update the program
Unfortunately, there is no easy way to update or auto-update at this time.

**For users with git**, run the following command:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/kevin931/PoetryPredictor.git
```

**For those who downloaded the zip file from GitHub**, the same download is necessary
again.

There will **NO** need to update the virtual environment with minor feature
updates or bug fixes.
