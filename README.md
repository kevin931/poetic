## About

Poetic (formerly **Poetry Predictor**) is a Python package and application based on Natural Language Processing and deep learning models to predict how poetic the English language is. Trained on 18th- and 19th-century works, the model predicts how likely the given input is or resembles poetry.

This initiative is originally part of the Robert Mayer Undergraduate Research Fellowship but now an independent, open-source project.

#### Why should you care?
- Are you ever in awe that a random phrase seems so **sexily poetic**?
- Have you ever looked for a poetry prediction tool or a toolchain to work in digital humaninities?
- Would you like to explore the possibilities of letting machine learning models to help define poetry in the digital age?

Look no further. You have found poetic.

**Have fun!!**

## Installation
Python (3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8) and pip (or conda) are required for Poetic to work. Now, poetic officially supports conda as well. Installation from either source will work, but stick to one or the other. 

To install from PyPi:

```shell
  pip install poetic-py
```

To install from conda: 

```shell
  conda install -c kevin931 poetic-py
  python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
```

For installation issues and some caveats, take a look [here](https://poetic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/Installation.html) for some common issues. Or, open an [issue](https://github.com/kevin931/poetic/issues) and I will be glad to help!

#### Dependencies
* tensorflow >= 2
* nltk
* gensim
* numpy

If you have encountered an issue with installation or dependencies, please open an issue so that I can help you out!

## Usage
Poetic supports three modes: command-line usage, python import, and GUI. For a detailed guide on examples and other common usages, visit the [Tutorials and Examples](https://poetic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/index.html) section of the documentation.

### Command-line Mode
A single command is sufficient without need of a python script or launching the GUI.

#### Flags
- ``-s`` or ``--Sentence``:  Supply a sentence or a string of text as an input.
- ``-f`` or ``--File``:      Supply the path to a plain text file.
- ``-o`` or ``--Out``:       Provide the path to save outputs
- ``-g`` or ``--GUI``:       Launch the GUI regardless of the other flags, except for -h.
- ``-h`` or ``--help``:      Help with flags.
- ``--version``:             Returns the version of the package.

#### Standard application with GUI
```shell
  python -m poetic
```

#### Make a sentence prediction
```shell
  python -m poetic -s "I am poetic. Are you?"
```

#### Make a file prediction
```shell
  python -m poetic -f "<PATH_TO_FILE>"
```

#### Save results to csv or text
```shell
  python -m poetic -f "<PATH_TO_FILE>" -o "<PATH>.txt"
  python -m poetic -f "<PATH_TO_FILE>" -o "<PATH>.csv"
  python -m poetic -s "I am poetic. Are you?" -o "<PATH>.txt"
```

### As a Python Package
Poetic contains two major classes: Predictor and Diagnostics. Predictor makes predictions and returns a predictions object inherited from the Diagnostics. For detailed methods and usage, check the [documentation](https://poetic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and its [Tutorials and Examples](https://poetic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/index.html#) section. The ``util`` module provides metadata, functionalities for loading and downloading necessary data, and initializing.

Below is the most common use-case as part of the IO and prediction toolchain:

```python
  import poetic

  new_pred = poetic.Predictor()
  sentence_result = new_pred.predict("I am poetic. Are you?")
  file_result = new_pred.predict_file("FILE_PATH.txt")

  # Process results
  sentence_result.run_diagnostics()
  sentence_result.to_file("SAVE_PATH.txt")
  sentence_result.to_csv("SAVE_PATH.csv")

```
