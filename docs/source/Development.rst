Development and Support
============================

Project Roadmap and Milestones
-------------------------------

Major milestones:

    * Support for poetic meter: both parsing and predicting
    * Support for custom models other than the ones provided

Tentative milestones (subject to change):

    * Backwards compatibility with Python 3.5 (No other versions support planned)
    * A better GUI
    * Package-level optimization


Future Support and Maintenance
-------------------------------

Patches (e.g. x.x.1):

    * Each patch consists mainly of bugs fixes, error corrections, and internal improvements.
    * No new feature will be introduced.

Minor Updates (e.g. x.1.x):

    * Each minor update will be supported and maintained for two minor release cycles after their relase. For example, v.1.0.x will be supported until the release of v.1.4.0.
    * All deprecations will be supported for two release cycles after warnings are posted.
    * The last version before each major release (except versions before v.1.0.0) will potentially have longer life cycles depending on the number of breaking changes.


Major Updates (e.g. 2.0.0):

    * There can be breaking changes without prior warnings.
    * Currently, there is not yet roadmap for the next major update on the horizon.
