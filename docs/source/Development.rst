Development and Support
============================

Project Roadmap and Milestones
-------------------------------

Major milestones:

    * Support for poetic meter: both parsing and predicting
    * Support for custom models other than the default model
    * Support for more default models

Tentative milestones (subject to change):

    * Backwards compatibility with Python 3.5 (No other versions support planned)
    * An improved GUI with better front and back end
    * Package-level optimization

Future Support and Maintenance
-------------------------------

Patches (e.g. x.x.1):

    * Each patch consists mainly of bugs fixes, error corrections, and internal improvements.
    * No new feature will be introduced.

Minor Updates (e.g. x.1.x):

    * Each minor update will be supported and maintained for two minor release cycles after their relase. For example, v.1.0.x will be supported until the release of v.1.3.0.
    * The last version before each major release (except versions before v.1.0.0) will potentially have longer life cycles depending on the number of breaking changes.

Major Updates (e.g. 2.0.0):

    * There can be breaking changes without prior warnings.
    * Currently, there is not yet roadmap for the next major update on the horizon.

Deprecations:

    * All deprecations will have clear warnings and be included in release notes.
    * Deprecations will be removed in the next major release.
    * Backwards compatibility will be maintained before their removed. No breaking changes will occur in minor updates.
