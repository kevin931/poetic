Contribution Guideline
=======================

Bug Reporting/Fixes
--------------------

I get it! I (or the team in the future) make mistakes. If something does not work
as intended or if there are any other bugs, please do let us know! 

     1. Check poetic's Github `issue tracker <https://github.com/kevin931/poetic/issues>`_
     2. If there is already the same issue, feel free to comment or help out! 
     3. If not, please open an issue with as much details as possible.
     4. Information to include:

        * Platform
        * OS
        * Package/Dependency versions (exporting the environment through pip or conda will be best)
        * Codes to reproduce the error

If you are able to help out with issues: 

    1. Go ahead and comment on the issue with how and in what ways you may resolve it. 
    2. If you have a pull request ready, submit it and also provide the necessary information to link it to the specific issue.
    3. I will review the codes, and if the fixes work as intended, I will merge the pull request.


Project Roadmap and Milestones
-------------------------------

Major milestones:

    * Support for poetic meter: both parsing and predicting
    * Support for custom models other than the ones provided

Tentative milestones (subject to change):

    * Backwards compatibility with Python 3.5 (No other versions support planned)
    * A better GUI
    * Package-level optimization


Feature Request
----------------

If there is something that you think will make this better, please let us know!

    1. Look through the Issue Tracker and, if appropriate, submit an issue for suggestion. 
    2. If the feature deviates from the roadmap significant, it will not be implemented. Otherwise, it will be considered based on the following factors:

        * Feature relevance
        * Current project development and timeline
        * Implementation logistics/complexity
        * External dependencies (if any)

    3. If you yourself would like to implement the feature, say so in the Issue, and I will evaluate it accordingly. 
    4. Bottomline: it doesn't hurt to ask and I'm pretty openminded.
