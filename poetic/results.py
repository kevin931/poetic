""" Module for processing prediction results.

The results module processes the outputs of prediction results
from the Predictor of the predictor module. The functionalities
provided include statistical summaries, io, and diagnostic
reports.

Examples:

    The results module's Diagnostics module can be used as part of
    the prediction workflow. To use its methods with the Predictor
    class: 
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
        pred = poetic.Predictor()
        result = pred.predict("This is an example.")
        result.run_diagnostics() # One-stop function
        result.to_file("<PATH>")
        
    To use without the Predictor class:
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
        pred = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
        result = Diagnostics(predictions=pred)
        five_number_summary = result.five_number()
        
    All public methods can be used without the run_diagnostics() method, but
    they depend on the diagnostic attribute, which the run_diagnostic()
    method generates.
